# What is Touchégg? #

Touchégg initially going to be designed to provide [Egg Window Manager](https://code.google.com/p/eggwm/) window management through gestures, but eventually I decided to extend this funcionality, so Touchégg is compatible with any window manager, and providing more options.

So Touchégg is a multi-touch gestures recognizer written in C + + using the Qt 4 and utouch-geis.

Through a simple configuration file you can attach an action to a particular gesture, and you can, by gestures on the trackpad, maximize or minimize windows, resize, show the desktop, emulate all mouse functions, and more.
